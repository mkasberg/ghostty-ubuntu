Description: Fast, feature-rich, and cross-platform terminal emulator (nightly builds)
 Ghostty is a terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being fast,
 feature-rich, and native. While there are many excellent terminal emulators
 available, they all force you to choose between speed, features, or native
 UIs. Ghostty provides all three.
 .
 This package contains nightly builds from the main branch.
